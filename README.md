# Open Plantb0t - Rev. A2

An "internet of things" environmental sensor board for your house plants & hydroponic systems. It allows you to monitor your plant health remotely, script responsive actions to events (not enough water, not enough sun, too hot, too cold, too humid, etc.) with a simple block-based drag and drop interface on your phone or computer.

**The preliminary specs are**

 - 1x Wifi enabled microprocessor
 - 1x USB board programmer for firmware updates
 - 4x Analog Sensor mounts (Water, Temperature, Light, ...)
 - 2x IÂ²C Sensor mounts (PH, Pressure, Humidity, etc. Not included or directly supported by us)

**Additional features**

 - Includes an ultra-low-power sleep which can't be woken via Wifi triggers.
 - Includes a 16-pin expansion bus header for more Plantb0t goodies.

Via the 16-pin header, several things can be added as shields (shields can stack on top of each other):

 - Power supply and battery charging circuit
 - Stepper motor driver
 - 12V motor driver
 - ... Your own? ...

More information on OpenPlantb0t will follow soon.
